              description="This project implements a Transformer-based neural machine translation system that translates between English and Manipuri language written in the Meetei Mayek script. Built using PyTorch, the system features a complete encoder-decoder architecture with multi-head attention mechanisms, custom tokenization handling for both languages, and GPU acceleration for efficient training. The model was trained on a parallel corpus of English-Manipuri text pairs and demonstrates the challenges of working with low-resource languages and non-Latin writing systems. The interactive chat functionality allows users to type English text and receive Manipuri translations in real-time, though some post-processing is needed to handle proper character spacing in the Meetei Mayek script output."
